## 3. Assumptions Made During Development

### Default Priority Levels

- Tasks are assigned one of three priority levels: **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**.

### Date Formatting

- The `date-fns` library is used to format the task creation date as `MMM dd yyyy`.

### Unique IDs

- Tasks are assigned unique IDs using `crypto.randomUUID()`, assuming browser support for this method.

### Single User Scope

- This version assumes a single-user application without authentication or multi-user functionality.

### Persistent State

- Currently, state is maintained in memory and will reset upon reload. Local storage or backend support is not included.
